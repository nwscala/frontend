# Shopify Image Repository Project - The Imaginarium (Frontend)

To start, you'll also need [Shopify Image Repository Project - The Imaginarium (Backend)](https://github.com/nwscala/shopify-image-repository-backend).
Then, Fork or Clone both this and the other repository into the same parent folder.
Then, cd into the backend folder and run `rails s` to start the backend server.
Then, cd into the frontend folder and run `yarn start` to start the frontend app.
Then, your browser should automatically open a webpage for you automatically at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost/3000) but if it doesn't, you can always navigate there manually. (FYI: the ruby server is hosted at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost/3001))
Once you reach the webpage, with both the backend and the frontend up and running, you can start to use the app by inputting links to images found on the wider web and titles for the images, both of which must be unique, and alt text for the images, which simply must exist.
You can also remove images from the webpage by clicking on the `Delete` button found on every image card.

What follows is the standard readme generated by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) which I will leave in as it may contain commands you would find useful.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
